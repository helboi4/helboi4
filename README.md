 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Get to know me and my journey</h3></summary>
  My love for coding began when I was about 10 years old where I, always a curious creative child, dove into trying to make my own games. I was never content in just consuming things I loved - I always wanted to break them down, understand how they work and create something new. I tried to learn java and made a few small maze games, but another interest of mine eventually swept me off my feet. I started learning Japaense by myself when I was 15 and ended up doing my degree in that and getting to spend a year abroad in Japan. I am hugely glad for the experience. It changed my life and allowed me to see across cultures, not to mention the skill of self-studying has become inordinately useful in my current path. However, after graduating I felt the itch to get back behind the IDE. I signed up to a 3 month coding bootcamp run by graduate agency Bright Netwrok. The road was tougher than I anticipated but I worked all day every day to skill up and land the role I have now. I have had a great year at Marks and Spencers and now have the confidence as a fully-formed engineer to start looking for the role that will form the next step in my career!
